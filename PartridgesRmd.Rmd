## Motivation

The preparation of scientific documents with mathematical content has always given
their authors and printers difficulty in rendering the material to paper or screen.
This article is part of an exercise to illustrate how different systems for preparing
such documents compare in capability and ease of use.

The text preparation systems to be compared are LaTeX (@lamport_latex_1986), Typst (@madje2022programmable) and Rmarkdown (@rmarkdown).
We note that bibliographic support is also of interest to users.

## A useful example

The Christmas counting song "The Twelve Days of Christmas" suggest the singer 
receives one gift -- we shall unabashedly simply declare that the Partridge in 
a Pear Tree is a single gift -- on the first of twelve days, then that gift plus
two more on the second, and so forth. For our needs, we want to have a general
formula for the total number of gifts received after $n$ days. While the commonly
known song uses 12 days, there are variants with other values of $n$. The Faroe
Islands use the inflationary value $n = 15$. In our exposition, we will rely on
the Wikipedia reference ??ref as our authority.

Thus we seek a formula for $T(n)$, the total number of presents received after
the $n$'th day.

## Single day number of presents

On a single day, the number of presents $S(n)$ is clearly the sum of an arithmetic
progression (??ref)

?? How to label equations on the same line??

$$ S(k) = \sum _{i = 1} ^k {i} $$
Clearly we now want to compute

$$ T(n) = \sum _{j = 1} ^n S(k) $$
The formula for $S(k)$ is well known, and derived by noting that writing the sequence forwards and then backwards illustrates that twice the sum is $k * (k+1)$, so we have

$$  S(k) = k (k + 1) / 2  $$
We can use this so that we find

$$  2 T(n) =  \sum _{k=1} ^n  {( k^2 + k )}  $$

We therefore need 

$$ Q(n) = \sum _{k = 1} ^n {k^2}$$

To give our provisional expression as

$$  T(n) = ( Q(n) + S(n) ) / 2 $$

$Q(n)$ is a well-known summation, often proved by mathematical induction,

$$  Q(n) = n (2 n + 1) (n + 1) / 6 $$
Thus we want (?? how to do multiline equation?)

$$       T(n) = ( n (2 n + 1 )(n+1) / 6 + n(n+1)/ 2) / 2 
            = ( 2 n^3 + 3 n^2 + n  + 3 n^2 + 3 n) / 12
            = ( 2 n^3 + 6 n^2 + 4 n)/12
            = ( n^3 + 3 n^2 + 2 n)/6  $$
```{r compute}
n <- 12
(n^3 + 3* n^2 + 2*n)/6
```
