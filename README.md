This repository is intended to provide a comparison of mathematical typesetting tools. In particular, we aim to compare
LaTeX, Typst, and Rmarkdown. To provide the illustration we use the development of the formula for the total number of 
presents received after n days in the song "The Twelve Days of Christmas". This is short enough to not pose a burden
in either development or reading, but has sufficient mathematical content to test the different platforms at least
superficially.
